# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to our Note App! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Note App built on the Flutter framework. By using our app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

### No Internet Access
Our Note App does not require internet access. It operates entirely offline, ensuring that your data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### Data We Collect
Since our app does not connect to the internet or any external servers, we do not collect any personal data, usage data, or any other information from your device. All notes and information you create and store within the app remain solely on your device.

### Local Storage
All notes and related data are stored locally on your device. This means that your data is secure and private, as it never leaves your device. We do not have access to your notes or any other information stored within the app.

## Security
We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. Since the app operates entirely offline and does not transmit data, the primary security measure is the protection of your device itself. We recommend that you use a secure password or biometric lock for your device to prevent unauthorized access.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app's settings or about section. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted within the app.
